# Tmux Syntax for Sublime Text

This project provides syntax definition for scripting Tmux configuration.

## Purpose

I want to `bat tmux.conf # with wings`.
I also want to share my `bat.conf` in my dotfiles without worry on licensing.
Unfortunately I couldn't find any good and safe project on Github.

Okay~ I do it myself~

## What

- Syntax highlighting for :file_folder: `tmux.conf`.
- Target to works on Sublime Text 3 and 4.
- Works with `bat` command.
- Code in modern `.sublime-syntax` rather than `.tmLanguage`.
- MIT licensed, so you can use, modify and share this repo without licensing problem.

## Status

I basically use this repo for `bat`.
The code is definitily over-simplified, but, at least, it shows "something" on screen.

I mannually verify the highlighting using `bat` on Linux and Sublime Text 3 on Windows.
I only need to display the config file "a little-bit nicer", rather than develop Tmux seriously.

I'm sure there is huge space for improvement, but I don't know how far I can go.

I will continue to develop this project base on user demand. Please star this project to notify me.

Welcome to open issues for request and improvements. Thanks!
